## **Title** : Generative AI : An Overview

### **_By_** : Gyan Prabhat
### **Supervisor**: [Dr. Anand Mishra](https://anandmishra22.github.io/) <br>

#### Overview
We are in the era of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI). With the paradigm shift of just looking for the patterns in the data, we have taken a step forward where we want to generate brand new data instances based on the patterns we have learnt from the given data. Deep Generative Modelling can be considered as a particular subset of Deep Learning where the end objective is to generate brand-new data instances. These are typically unsupervised learning methods, where we are provided with the training data X which is coming from a probability distribution $p_{data}(x)$. However, we do not know whatsoever about the data-generating distribution. What we want to learn is a $p_{model}(x)$, such that the learn distribution is as close as possible to the original data distribution. If we can do that, then we can use the learned distribution to sample new data instances.
